# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Task:
Create a responsive image gallery using React JS with the following features: reordering, deleting multiple images, and setting a feature image. The gallery should be visually appealing and provide a seamless user experience.

## Requirements:
1. **Gallery Layout:**
   - Implement a grid layout for the image gallery.
   - The gallery should display images with one feature image larger than the others.
2. **Sorting:**
   - Enable reordering functionality to allow users to rearrange the order of images in the gallery.
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality or any other intuitive method for reordering.
3. **Deleting Multiple Images:**
   - Allow users to select multiple images and delete them.
   - Provide a clear visual indication of selected images.
4. **Setting Feature Image:**
   - Allow users to set a feature image by sorting.
   - Pretend the first image (from the LTR direction) as the featured image
   - The feature image should be visually distinct from the other images.
